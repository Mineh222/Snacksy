## Technical Details
***Shopping Cart***:

The implementation of Snacksy's shopping cart was done by implementing a join table in which a many-to-many relationship between shopping carts and snacks was created. Adding to and deleting items from a shopping cart was then done through adding and deleting rows in the join table and accessing the snacks through the shopping cart's to_dict method:
```
  @cart_routes.route('/<id>', methods=['POST'])
  def add_to_cart(id):
    data = request.json

    cart = ShoppingCart.query.get(id)
    db.session.execute(items.insert().values(
        shopping_cart_id=id, snack_id=data[0], quantity=data[1]))
    db.session.commit()
    return cart.to_dict()
```
```
    def getsnacked(self):
        data = [snack.to_dict() for snack in self.snacks]
        return data

    def to_dict(self):
        return {
            'id': self.id,
            'user_id': self.user_id,
            'user': self.user.to_dict(),
            'snacks': self.getsnacked(),
            'cart_quantity': len(self.cart_items)
        }
```
***Search Bar***:

Creating a search bar was something that was an extremly new concept to the development team but was a fun task to take on. Users have the ability to search for a specific snack in our database or just to get back a list of results that matches anything that they search. Unfortunately we dont have all the snacks in our database but for this being our first searh bar, we are happy with the way things turned out. 

```
const handleFilter = (e) => {
        const searchWord = e.target.value;
        setWordEntry(searchWord);
        const newFilter = snacks.filter((value) => {
            return value.title.toLowerCase().includes(searchWord.toLowerCase());
        });

        if (searchWord === "") {
            setFilteredSnacks([])
        } else {
            setFilteredSnacks(newFilter)
        }
    }
```
```
{filteredSnacks.length !== 0 && (
                <div className="snack-result">
                    {filteredSnacks.slice(0, 5).map((snack) => {
                        return (
                            <Link key={snack.id} className="snack-item" to={`/snacks/${snack.id}`} onClick={clearInput}>
                                <p id='snack-title'>{snack.title}</p>
                            </Link>
                        )
                    })}
                </div>
            )}
```
